# DATA 512 Assignment A2: Bias

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to identify potential sources of bias in a corpus of human-annotated data, and describe some implications of those biases. In other words, we wish to identify what, if any, sources of bias may exist in these datasets, and to develop testable hypotheses about how these biases might impact the behavior of machine learning models trained on the data, when those models are used for research purposes or to power data-driven applications. 

## Data Source
Google data scientists used these ([annotated datasets](https://figshare.com/projects/Wikipedia_Talk/16731)) to train machine learning models as part of a project called ([Conversation AI](https://conversationai.github.io/)). The models have been used in a variety of software products and made freely accessible to anyone through the Perspective API.
